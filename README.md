# object-detection-tfod

Object detection script written using Tensorflow's object detection API, using a  pretrained faster-RCCN model.

Dataset trained on: [Roboflow mask wearing dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/mask-wearing/4/download/tensorflow).

[LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg) was used to label and annotate images.

[This](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ljvc9t2gSjwVNhmK2FcFjfR99xzMT1ji?usp=sharing) was the directory in google drive used in colab.

The model used was [Faster R-CNN ResNet50 V1 640x640](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/faster_rcnn_resnet50_v1_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz)
